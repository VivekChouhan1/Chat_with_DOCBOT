There is something wrong with my hand. Can you please see it and tell me what it is?","With what I see, I think you have a skin condition on your hand that appears to be eczema or dermatitis, characterized by redness, inflammation, and possible dryness. I would suggest applying a topical corticosteroid cream to reduce inflammation and itching, and also recommend keeping the area moisturized with a gentle, fragrance-free lotion to help soothe and protect the skin.",,2025-09-15 04:25:35.848772
